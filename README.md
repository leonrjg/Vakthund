Self-hosted web dashboard for security researchers to manage and track IoT devices obtained from public sources such as Shodan or ZoomEye.

## 游릜 Features:
游릭 Periodically save devices that match certain criteria on the search engines

游릭 Configure and execute actions targeting certain devices

游릭 Choose what search engine to use for each device

游릭 Confirm whether a host is online directly on the web interface

## Setup
```sh
git clone https://github.com/leonrjg/Vakthund.git
cd Vakthund

# Install Python requirements
python -m pip install -r vakthund-engine/requirements.txt

# Build and start the server
npm install
npm run build
npm run start-server

# Build and start the client
cd vakthund-web
npm install
npm run build
npm run start-client
```

Once the setup is done, go to http://localhost:18000 on your browser.

If the app is not working, the following commands might help.

## Troubleshooting
```sh
pm2 kill # This will kill any zombie processes that might prevent us from trying to start the server again
npm run start-server-sync # This will start the server in blocking mode to allow viewing error logs
...
cd vakthund-web
npm run start-client-sync
```

### Tips
- Make sure the app's source directory is writable since the app will attempt to create a SQLite database there if no other DBMS is configured.
- If you wish to use another DBMS, set the following environment variables accordingly: `db_type` `db_host` `db_user` `db_password` `db_name`

## Configuration
By following the previous steps, you will have the web dashboard working; however, the component responsible for grabbing/updating the devices from the search engines must be executed separately:
```sh
cd vakthund-engine
python main.py
```
- It is recommended to **schedule a cron job** that runs this script at your desired frequency.

- Please remember to add your search engine API keys (Shodan, ZoomEye, or both) by navigating to the _Settings_ page of the web dashboard.

### Mocks
If you do not have API keys and wish to try the app with test data, set the `vk_use_mocks` environment variable to any value and run the previous `vakthund-engine` script.
The web dashboard should then be populated with a few test items.
