Self-hosted web dashboard for security researchers to manage and track IoT devices obtained from public sources such as Shodan or ZoomEye.

![vk example](https://github.com/leonrjg/Vakthund/assets/5253770/63d45f38-7a39-43b0-8003-2a1e91535bed)



## 游릜 Features:
游릭 Periodically save hosts that match certain criteria on the search engines

游릭 Configure and execute actions targeting certain hosts

游릭 Choose what search engine to use for each device

游릭 Filter hosts by tag, device type or any related value

游릭 Confirm whether a host is online directly on the web interface

游릭 See the full result from the search engine on the web interface

## Setup
Requirements: Node.js 18+, Python 3
```sh
git clone https://github.com/leonrjg/Vakthund.git
cd Vakthund

# Install Python requirements
# If this fails, see the troubleshooting section below
python -m pip install -r vakthund-engine/requirements.txt

# Build and start the server
npm install
npm run build
npm run start-server

# Build and start the client
cd vakthund-web
npm install
npm run build
npm run start-client
```

Once the setup is done, go to http://localhost:18000 on your browser.

If the app is not working, the following commands might help.

## Troubleshooting
```sh
# Python package issues
    # If you're getting the "This environment is externally managed" error and you're running this on a container or otherwise don't mind cluttering your Python installation, you can ignore it and append "--break-system-packages"
    python -m pip install -r vakthund-engine/requirements.txt --break-system-packages
    
    # If you're not running this on a container, use VirtualEnv
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python -m pip install -r vakthund-engine/requirements.txt

# General debug
    pm2 kill # This will kill any zombie processes that might prevent us from trying to start the server again
    npm run start-server-sync # This will start the server in blocking mode to allow viewing error logs
    ...
    cd vakthund-web
    npm run start-client-sync
    
# Example setup on a Debian container
    apt update && apt install build-essential git python3 python3-pip python-is-python3 npm --no-install-recommends -y && git clone https://github.com/leonrjg/Vakthund.git && cd Vakthund && python -m pip install --break-system-packages -r vakthund-engine/requirements.txt && npm install && npm run build && npm run start-server && cd vakthund-web && npm install && npm run build && npm run start-client
```

### Tips
- Make sure the app's source directory is writable since the app will attempt to create a SQLite database there if no other DBMS is configured.
- If you wish to use another DBMS, set the following environment variables accordingly: `db_type=[sqlite|mysql|postgres]` `db_host` `db_user` `db_password` `db_name`
- If using a container, expose ports 18000 (web UI) and 18001 (web API).

## Configuration
By following the previous steps, you will have the web dashboard working; however, the component responsible for grabbing/updating the devices from the search engines must be executed separately:
```sh
cd vakthund-engine
python main.py
```
- Make sure **at least one device exists** before running the engine, even if using [vk-use-mocks](#mock-data).
- It is recommended to **schedule a cron job** that runs this script at your desired frequency.
- You can add your search engine API keys (Shodan, ZoomEye, or both) by navigating to the _Settings_ page of the web dashboard.

### Mock data
If you do not have API keys and wish to try the app with test data, set the `vk_use_mocks` environment variable to any value and run the previous `vakthund-engine` script.
The web dashboard should then be populated with a few test items.
