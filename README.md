## Setup (Docker)
Requirements: Node.js 18+, Python 3
```sh
git clone https://github.com/leonrjg/Vakthund.git
cd Vakthund
docker compose up
```

Once the setup is done, go to http://localhost:18000 on your browser.
If the app is not working, the following commands might help:

## Troubleshooting

### Tips
- Make sure the "data" directory is writable since the app will attempt to create a SQLite database there if no other DBMS is configured.
- If you wish to use another DBMS, set the following environment variables accordingly: `db_type=[sqlite|mysql|postgres]` `db_host` `db_user` `db_password` `db_name`

## Configuration
By following the previous steps, you will have the web dashboard working; however, the component responsible for grabbing/updating the devices from the search engines must be executed separately:
```sh
cd vakthund-engine
python main.py
```
**Running the scan from the web UI is a planned feature.**
You can add your search engine API keys (Shodan, ZoomEye, etc) on the **Settings** page of the web dashboard.
