Self-hosted web dashboard for security researchers to manage and track IoT devices obtained from public sources such as Shodan or ZoomEye.

![vk example](https://github.com/leonrjg/Vakthund/assets/5253770/63d45f38-7a39-43b0-8003-2a1e91535bed)

## 游릜 Features:
游릭 Periodically save hosts that match certain criteria on IoT search engines

游릭 Configure and execute actions targeting certain hosts

游릭 Add multiple search engine queries for each device

游릭 Filter hosts by tag, device type or any related value

游릭 Confirm whether a host is online directly on the web interface

游릭 See the full result from the search engine on the web interface

## Setup (Docker)
Requirements: Node.js 18+, Python 3
```sh
git clone https://github.com/leonrjg/Vakthund.git
cd Vakthund
docker compose up
```

Once the setup is done, go to http://localhost:18000 on your browser.

If the app is not working, the following commands might help:

## Troubleshooting

### Tips
- Make sure the "data" directory is writable since the app will attempt to create a SQLite database there if no other DBMS is configured.
- If you wish to use another DBMS, set the following environment variables accordingly: `db_type=[sqlite|mysql|postgres]` `db_host` `db_user` `db_password` `db_name`

## Configuration
By following the previous steps, you will have the web dashboard working; however, the component responsible for grabbing/updating the devices from the search engines must be executed separately:
```sh
cd vakthund-engine
python main.py
```
**Running the scan from the web UI is a planned feature.**
- You can add your search engine API keys (Shodan, ZoomEye, etc) on the **Settings** page of the web dashboard.
